*Random Time Table Generator*

This project will help you generate a random timetable for your specific subjects.

`How it Works:`

You will need to run Main.java and follow the prompt messages.

Each subject has a name and size.
The program needs the number of days to spread subjects upon randomly.

After entering days remaining, the schedule will be shown.
